      'Whilst working at Redback Solutions in mid 2014 I was given the task of creating a responsive redesign of the Lake Macquarie Holiday Parks website. The opportunity of working on a larger project enabled me to spend time producing a unique and memorable experience for visitors to the site, regardless of the device they\'re using.',
      'I enjoyed the challenge of designing and prototyping card flip animations and other interactive elements whilst considering how desktop, tablet and mobile devices could handle them.',
      'A major component of the redesign involved creating a Park Information page for each of the four holiday parks. This was a fairly complex page with a large amount of information needing to be thoughfully presented within a small space. A two column, full-width layout enabled us to utilise the entire screen and display as much information as posible.'
